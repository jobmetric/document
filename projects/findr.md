# Findr

A dynamic platform designed to `connect users` with `skilled professionals`, allowing for efficient searches and in-depth evaluations of expertise.

## Installation

Run the following command to pull in the latest version:

```bash
composer require jobmetric/findr
```

### Publish the config

Run the following command to publish the package config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JobMetric\Findr\FindrServiceProvider" --tag="findr-config"
```

You should now have a `config/findr.php` file that allows you to configure the basics of this package.
