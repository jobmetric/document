# Build Multilingual Applications. Effortlessly.

**Laravel Translation** is a powerful package that simplifies the management of multilingual content within Laravel applications. It offers dynamic translation storage, retrieval, and updates, seamlessly integrating with your models through the `HasTranslation` trait. Stop managing translations manually and start building truly multilingual applications with ease.

## Why Laravel Translation?

### Seamless Model Integration

Laravel Translation integrates directly with your Eloquent models through a simple trait. No complex setup, no additional services—just add the trait and define which fields should be translatable. Your models become multilingual instantly.

### Flexible Field Control

You have complete control over which fields can be translated. Whitelist specific fields or allow all fields with a simple configuration. This flexibility ensures you only translate what needs to be translated, keeping your database clean and efficient.

### Version History Built-In

Track every change to your translations with optional versioning. See what changed, when it changed, and restore previous versions if needed. Perfect for content management systems where translation history matters.

### Powerful Query Capabilities

Search and filter your models based on translated content. Find products by their translated names, filter posts by translated titles, and build multilingual search functionality with ease.

### Simple, Intuitive API

The package provides an intuitive API that feels natural to Laravel developers. Create, read, update, and delete translations with simple methods that work exactly as you'd expect.

## What is Translation Management?

Translation management is the process of storing and retrieving content in multiple languages. In a traditional Laravel application, you might store translations in language files or use separate columns for each language. Laravel Translation takes a different approach:

- **Database-Driven**: Translations are stored in the database, making them dynamic and manageable through your application
- **Per-Field Translations**: Each field can have different translations for different locales
- **Version Control**: Track changes to translations over time
- **Query Support**: Search and filter by translated content directly in your queries

## Key Features

### Custom Validation

Ensures translation data integrity with flexible rules and error handling. Validate translations just like any other model attribute.

### Model Integration

Supports multi-language attributes with versioning, soft deletes, and event-driven updates. Works seamlessly with all Eloquent features.

### API Resources

Provides structured serialization for translation data, facilitating clean API responses. Transform your models with translations included.

### Extensible Architecture

Includes custom exceptions, event handling, and dynamic translation management for scalable localization. Extend and customize as needed.

### Query Support

Enables scope queries and relationship management for efficient multilingual data handling. Find models by their translated content.

### Language Files

Centralized language files for consistent, maintainable multilingual user communication. Keep your validation messages and UI text organized.

## Quick Example

See how easy it is to make your models multilingual:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use JobMetric\Translation\HasTranslation;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasTranslation;

    protected array $translatables = ['title', 'summary', 'body'];
    protected bool $translationVersioning = true;
}

// Create with translations
$post = Post::create([
    'slug' => 'hello-world',
    'translation' => [
        'en' => [
            'title' => 'Hello World',
            'summary' => 'My first post',
        ],
        'fa' => [
            'title' => 'سلام دنیا',
            'summary' => 'اولین پست من',
        ],
    ],
]);

// Retrieve translations
echo $post->getTranslation('title', 'fa');  // سلام دنیا
echo $post->getTranslation('title', 'en');  // Hello World
```
