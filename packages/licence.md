# License

All JobMetric packages documented in this documentation system are licensed under the MIT License.

## Package vs Project

In our documentation system, we distinguish between **packages** and **projects**:

- **Packages**: Reusable Laravel packages that can be installed via Composer and used in any Laravel application. These are the tools and libraries we provide to the Laravel community.
- **Projects**: Complete applications or solutions built using our packages or other technologies.

This license applies specifically to all **packages** that are documented within this documentation system. Each package maintains its own repository and may have additional license information in its respective repository.
