# Build Forms. Beautifully and Consistently.

**Laravel Custom Field** is a powerful package that provides a fluent builder API to define, render, and serialize form fields with consistent HTML output. It supports all standard HTML input types (text, number, select, radio, image, etc.) with an extendable option/data system, making it perfect for building dynamic forms, admin panels, and API-driven form builders.

## Why Laravel Custom Field?

### Fluent Builder API

Laravel Custom Field provides a clean, chainable API for building form fields. Set attributes, properties, options, and data attributes in a single fluent chain—no more scattered HTML or inconsistent form rendering.

### Consistent HTML Output

All fields render with consistent HTML structure, making it easy to style and maintain forms across your application. The package handles all the boilerplate, so you focus on your business logic.

### Extensible Architecture

Create custom field types by extending the base classes. The package uses a registry system that makes it easy to add new field types and customize existing ones.

### Asset Management

Fields can include their own JavaScript and CSS assets. The package automatically collects and provides asset paths, making it easy to include field-specific functionality.

### Option System

Powerful option builder for select, radio, and checkbox fields. Build options via closures for bulk operations or arrays for simple cases.

### Data Attributes Support

Easily add data attributes to fields for JavaScript integration, AJAX handling, or any custom functionality you need.

## What is Custom Field Management?

Custom field management is the process of programmatically creating, configuring, and rendering form fields. Traditional approaches often involve:

- Writing HTML manually (error-prone, inconsistent)
- Using form builders (limited flexibility)
- Creating custom components (time-consuming)

Laravel Custom Field solves these challenges by providing:

- **Fluent API**: Chain methods to build fields
- **Type Safety**: Strongly-typed field classes
- **Consistent Output**: Standardized HTML structure
- **Extensibility**: Easy to create custom field types
- **Asset Management**: Automatic script/style collection
- **Template System**: Customizable blade templates

## Key Features

### Field Types

Support for all standard HTML input types:
- Text, Number, Email, Tel, Password
- Select, Radio, Checkbox

### Attributes & Properties

Set HTML attributes (id, name, class, placeholder, etc.) and properties (required, disabled, readonly, multiple, etc.) through fluent methods.

Powerful builder for select/radio/checkbox options with support for labels, values, selected states, and custom attributes.

### Data Attributes

Add data attributes for JavaScript integration, AJAX handling, or custom functionality.

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to build forms:

```php
use JobMetric\CustomField\CustomFieldBuilder;

// Text field
$text = CustomFieldBuilder::text()
    ->name('user[name]')
    ->label('Name')
    ->info('Enter your full name')
    ->required()
    ->placeholder('Enter name')
    ->build();

// Select with options
$select = CustomFieldBuilder::select()
    ->name('country')
    ->label('Country')
    ->options(function ($opt) {
        $opt->label('Iran')->value('IR')->selected()->build();
        $opt->label('Germany')->value('DE')->build();
    })
    ->build();

// Render HTML
$html = $text->toHtml();
echo $html['body'];
```

## Creating and Registering Custom Fields

One of the most powerful features of Laravel Custom Field is the ability to create your own custom field types. The process is straightforward:

1. **Create the Field**: Use the `custom-field:make` command to generate a new field class
2. **Customize**: Add your field-specific logic, attributes, and view templates
3. **Register**: Register your field in a service provider using `CustomFieldRegistry`
4. **Use**: Your field becomes available through `CustomFieldBuilder`
