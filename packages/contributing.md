# Contributing to JobMetric Packages

Thank you for considering contributing to JobMetric packages! We appreciate your interest in making our projects better and welcome your contributions.

## How to Contribute

We believe that open collaboration leads to the best results. To contribute to any JobMetric package, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Fork the specific package repository to your own GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project under your account.

2. **Clone the repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. This allows you to work on the project locally.

3. **Create a branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch in the repository. The branch name should be descriptive and reflect the changes you plan to make.

4. **Make changes**: Make your desired changes and improvements to the project. Please ensure that your changes adhere to the coding guidelines and best practices of the project.

5. **Test your changes**: Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended and do not introduce any new issues.

6. **Commit your changes**: Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them with clear and concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.

7. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and create a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch of the original repository. Provide a detailed description of the changes you made, the problem you solved, and any other relevant information.

8. **Code Review**: The project maintainers will review your Pull Request. Be prepared to make changes or address any feedback you receive during the review process.

9. **Merge**: Once your Pull Request has been approved and any necessary changes have been made, it will be merged into the main project. Congratulations on your successful contribution!
