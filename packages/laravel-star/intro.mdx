# Build Star Ratings. Simply and Powerfully.

**Laravel Star** is a modern, flexible package that allows your Eloquent models to handle star rating functionality (e.g., 1 to 5 stars). It provides a clean API for both **starable** models (e.g., articles, products) and **starrer** models (e.g., users, devices), making it easy to implement rating systems in your Laravel applications.

## Why Laravel Star?

### Simple API

Laravel Star provides a clean, intuitive API for managing star ratings. Add, update, remove, and query ratings with simple method calls—no complex queries or manual relationship management.

### Flexible Rating Scale

Support any rating scale you need: 1-5 stars, 0-10, or any custom range. The package is fully configurable to match your application's requirements.

### Anonymous Ratings

Support both authenticated user ratings and anonymous device-based ratings. Perfect for applications where users can rate without logging in, or where you need to track ratings by device.

### Polymorphic Relationships

Use star ratings on any Eloquent model through polymorphic relationships. Products, articles, reviews, services—anything can be starable, and any model can be a starrer.

### Event System

Built-in events for rating lifecycle: `StarAddEvent`, `StarUpdatingEvent`, `StarUpdatedEvent`, `StarRemovingEvent`, and `StarRemovedEvent`. Integrate with notification systems, analytics, or any custom logic.

### Rich Querying

Query ratings by value, starrer, starable, device, and more. Get rating summaries, averages, counts, and lists with simple method calls.

## What is Star Rating Management?

Star rating management is the process of allowing users or devices to rate content using a numeric scale (typically 1-5 stars). Traditional approaches often involve:

- Creating separate tables for each rating type
- Writing complex queries to calculate averages
- Managing rating state manually
- Duplicating code across different models

Laravel Star solves these challenges by providing:

- **Unified System**: Single table for all star ratings
- **Polymorphic Design**: Works with any model
- **Simple API**: Clean methods for all operations
- **Event Integration**: Built-in events for extensibility
- **Query Helpers**: Easy methods for common queries

## Key Features

### HasStar Trait

Add to models that can receive star ratings (products, articles, reviews, etc.). Provides methods to add, remove, update, and query ratings.

### CanStar Trait

Add to models that can give star ratings (users, devices, etc.). Provides methods to check rating status, get rating history, and manage ratings given.

### Star Model

The Eloquent model that stores all star ratings. Supports polymorphic relationships and includes automatic IP and device tracking.

### Events

Five events for rating lifecycle:
- `StarAddEvent`: When a rating is added
- `StarUpdatingEvent`: Before a rating is updated
- `StarUpdatedEvent`: After a rating is updated
- `StarRemovingEvent`: Before a rating is removed
- `StarRemovedEvent`: After a rating is removed

### Anonymous Support

Track ratings by device ID for anonymous users, perfect for public-facing content where users don't need to log in.

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to use star ratings:

```php
use JobMetric\Star\HasStar;
use JobMetric\Star\CanStar;

// Product model (can receive ratings)
class Product extends Model
{
    use HasStar;
}

// User model (can give ratings)
class User extends Model
{
    use CanStar;
}

// Usage
$product = Product::find(1);
$user = User::find(1);

// Add a 5-star rating
$product->addStar(5, $user);

// Check if user rated the product
$product->hasStar($user);

// Get average rating
$average = $product->starAvg();

// Get rating count
$count = $product->starCount();
```
