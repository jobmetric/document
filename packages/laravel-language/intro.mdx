# Build Language Management. Simply and Powerfully.

**Laravel Language** is a modern, flexible package that provides a clean, framework-native way to manage application languages with first-class validation rules, events, and a fluent query API. It supports multiple calendar systems, text directions, and provides comprehensive tools for internationalization and localization.

## Why Laravel Language?

### Simple API

Laravel Language provides a clean, intuitive API for managing languages. Store, update, delete, and query languages with simple method calls through the service or facade.

### Calendar Awareness

Support for multiple calendar systems: Gregorian, Jalali, Hijri, Hebrew, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopian, and Chinese. Each language can have its own calendar preference.

### Validation Rules

Built-in validation rules: `CheckLocaleRule` and `LanguageExistRule` ensure data integrity and validate locale codes.

### Event System

Built-in events for language lifecycle: `LanguageStoredEvent`, `LanguageUpdatedEvent`, `LanguageDeletingEvent`, and `LanguageDeletedEvent`. Integrate with notification systems, caching, or any custom logic.

### Middleware Support

Built-in middleware for setting language and timezone automatically based on user preferences or request parameters.

### Rich Querying

Query languages with filters, sorts, and field selection using Spatie QueryBuilder under the hood.

### API Resources

Optional API resources for transforming language data for API responses.

## What is Language Management?

Language management is the process of managing multiple languages in your application, including locale settings, text direction (LTR/RTL), calendar systems, and formatting preferences. Traditional approaches often involve:

- Creating custom language tables manually
- Writing complex queries to filter and sort languages
- Managing locale settings manually
- Duplicating code across different parts of the application

Laravel Language solves these challenges by providing:

- **Unified System**: Single table for all language data
- **Calendar Support**: Multiple calendar systems out of the box
- **Simple API**: Clean methods for all operations
- **Event Integration**: Built-in events for extensibility
- **Query Helpers**: Easy methods for common queries

## Key Features

### Language Service

The main service class that provides methods for storing, updating, deleting, and querying languages. Can be used directly or through the facade.

### Language Model

The Eloquent model that stores language data. Includes query scopes for filtering by locale, direction, and calendar.

### Calendar Type Enum

Enum for calendar system types: Gregorian, Jalali, Hijri, Hebrew, Buddhist, Coptic, Ethiopian, and Chinese.

### Validation Rules

- `CheckLocaleRule`: Validates locale codes
- `LanguageExistRule`: Validates language existence
- `CheckFutureDateRule`: Validates future dates based on calendar

### Middleware

- `SetLanguageMiddleware`: Automatically sets application locale
- `SetTimezoneMiddleware`: Automatically sets application timezone

### Events

Four events for language lifecycle:
- `LanguageStoredEvent`: When a language is created
- `LanguageUpdatedEvent`: When a language is updated
- `LanguageDeletingEvent`: Before a language is deleted
- `LanguageDeletedEvent`: After a language is deleted

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to use language management:

```php
use JobMetric\Language\Facades\Language;

// Store a new language
$language = Language::store([
    'name' => 'Persian',
    'flag' => 'ir',
    'locale' => 'fa',
    'direction' => 'rtl',
    'calendar' => 'jalali',
    'first_day_of_week' => 0,
    'status' => true,
]);

// Get all active languages
$languages = Language::all(['status' => true]);

// Update a language
Language::update($id, [
    'name' => 'فارسی',
    'status' => true,
]);

// Delete a language
Language::delete($id);
```
