# Manage Metadata. Simply and Flexibly.

**Laravel Metadata** is a powerful package that provides a robust and flexible metadata system for Laravel Eloquent models. It enables you to attach dynamic key-value data to any model through a polymorphic relationship, perfect for storing custom fields, settings, options, and user-defined attributes without modifying your database schema.

## Why Laravel Metadata?

### Dynamic Key-Value Storage

Laravel Metadata allows you to store arbitrary key-value pairs for any Eloquent model without modifying the model's table structure. This is perfect for storing custom fields, user preferences, product attributes, and any other extensible data.

### Polymorphic Relationships

The package uses Laravel's polymorphic relationships, allowing a single `metas` table to store metadata for multiple model types. This keeps your database schema clean and maintainable while providing maximum flexibility.

### Key Whitelisting

Control which metadata keys are allowed for each model. Define a whitelist of allowed keys to prevent typos and ensure data integrity, or use `['*']` to allow all keys.

### Automatic JSON Handling

Arrays and objects are automatically JSON-encoded when stored and decoded when retrieved. The package tracks which values are JSON, ensuring proper type handling.

### Event System

Laravel Metadata integrates with Laravel Event System, firing events when metadata is stored or deleted. Listen to these events to implement custom logic, logging, or notifications.

### Query Scopes

Use query scopes to filter models based on their metadata. Find all models with a specific metadata key or value, making it easy to build dynamic filtering systems.

## What is Metadata Management?

Metadata management is the process of storing and retrieving additional information about your models that doesn't fit into the main table structure. Traditional approaches often require:

- Adding columns to tables (inflexible)
- Creating separate tables for each model (redundant)
- Using JSON columns (limited querying)

Laravel Metadata solves these challenges by providing:

- **Polymorphic Storage**: One table for all metadata across all models
- **Dynamic Keys**: Add new metadata keys without schema changes
- **Type Safety**: Automatic JSON encoding/decoding
- **Query Support**: Filter and search by metadata
- **Key Control**: Whitelist allowed keys per model

## Key Features

### HasMeta Trait

The core trait that adds metadata functionality to any Eloquent model. Provides methods for storing, retrieving, and managing metadata.

### HasFilterMeta Trait

Adds dynamic filtering capabilities based on metadata. Perfect for building admin panels and APIs that need to filter models by metadata values.

### HasDynamicMeta Trait

Integrates with custom field systems to automatically manage allowed metadata keys based on model types.

### Batch Operations

Store or delete multiple metadata entries in a single operation, improving performance for bulk updates.

### Model Events

Metadata operations trigger Laravel events, allowing you to hook into the metadata lifecycle for custom logic.

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to work with metadata:

```php
use JobMetric\Metadata\HasMeta;

class Product extends Model
{
    use HasMeta;

    protected array $metadata = [
        'color',
        'size',
        'weight',
        'dimensions',
    ];
}

// Store metadata
$product = Product::find(1);
$product->storeMetadata('color', 'red');
$product->storeMetadata('dimensions', ['width' => 10, 'height' => 20]);

// Retrieve metadata
$color = $product->getMetadata('color');
$dimensions = $product->getMetadata('dimensions');

// Store multiple at once
$product->storeMetadataBatch([
    'color' => 'blue',
    'size' => 'large',
    'weight' => 500,
]);

// Query by metadata
$redProducts = Product::hasMetaKey('color')->get();
```
