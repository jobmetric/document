# Workflow for laravel

This package is for creating different workflows in different Laravel projects.

## Make Workflow your Way

`Workflow` streamlines the creation of processes within your program. By entrusting process creation to system administrators, you alleviate yourself from redundant tasks. This methodology not only allows you to tackle smaller tasks more efficiently but also empowers you to craft comprehensive projects with ease. Additionally, the package automates updates and handles a variety of other functionalities, enhancing the overall productivity of your development process.

## What is Workflow?

Expanding on this example, envision the intricacies involved in the salary increase request. As it navigates through various hierarchical levels department manager, company manager, and finance manager each step introduces a unique state. These transitions aren't merely a change in status; they represent a dynamic evolution of the request.

Consider the scenario where the finance unit gives its approval. This transition triggers a series of automated tasks, such as sending an SMS notification to the user. The power of workflow management lies not only in progressing through states but also in orchestrating corresponding actions seamlessly.

Moreover, in the realm of workflows, the concept of end states becomes pivotal. A workflow may culminate in multiple end states, reflecting different outcomes or resolutions. This flexibility caters to the diverse paths a process can take based on approvals, rejections, or any other pertinent factors.

In essence, leveraging a robust workflow system empowers your program to efficiently handle complex processes, providing a structured and automated approach to tasks. By incorporating this package into your development toolkit, you can streamline processes, enhance productivity, and navigate the intricate web of state transitions with ease.
