# Build Reactions. Simply and Powerfully.

**Laravel Reaction** is a modern, flexible package that allows your Eloquent models to handle reaction functionality (like, dislike, love, etc.). It provides a clean API for both **reactable** models (e.g., articles, posts) and **reactor** models (e.g., users, devices), making it easy to implement social interaction features in your Laravel applications.

## Why Laravel Reaction?

### Simple API

Laravel Reaction provides a clean, intuitive API for managing reactions. Add, remove, toggle, and query reactions with simple method calls—no complex queries or manual relationship management.

### Flexible Reaction Types

Support any reaction type you need: like, dislike, love, heart, thumbs up, and more. The package doesn't limit you to predefined reaction types—use whatever makes sense for your application.

### Anonymous Reactions

Support both authenticated user reactions and anonymous device-based reactions. Perfect for applications where users can react without logging in, or where you need to track reactions by device.

### Polymorphic Relationships

Use reactions on any Eloquent model through polymorphic relationships. Articles, posts, comments, products—anything can be reactable, and any model can be a reactor.

### Event System

Built-in events for reaction lifecycle: `ReactionAddEvent`, `ReactionRemovingEvent`, and `ReactionRemovedEvent`. Integrate with notification systems, analytics, or any custom logic.

### Soft Deletes & Pruning

Reactions use soft deletes, allowing you to restore deleted reactions. Automatic pruning support helps keep your database clean by removing old soft-deleted reactions.

### Rich Querying

Query reactions by type, reactor, reactable, device, and more. Get reaction summaries, counts, and lists with simple method calls.

## What is Reaction Management?

Reaction management is the process of allowing users or devices to express their feelings or opinions about content through reactions. Traditional approaches often involve:

- Creating separate tables for each reaction type (likes, dislikes, etc.)
- Writing complex queries to check reaction status
- Managing reaction state manually
- Duplicating code across different models

Laravel Reaction solves these challenges by providing:

- **Unified System**: Single table for all reaction types
- **Polymorphic Design**: Works with any model
- **Simple API**: Clean methods for all operations
- **Event Integration**: Built-in events for extensibility
- **Query Helpers**: Easy methods for common queries

## Key Features

### HasReaction Trait

Add to models that can receive reactions (articles, posts, comments, etc.). Provides methods to add, remove, toggle, and query reactions.

### CanReact Trait

Add to models that can give reactions (users, devices, etc.). Provides methods to check reaction status, get reaction history, and manage reactions given.

### Reaction Model

The Eloquent model that stores all reactions. Supports soft deletes, automatic pruning, and polymorphic relationships.

### Events

Three events for reaction lifecycle:
- `ReactionAddEvent`: When a reaction is added
- `ReactionRemovingEvent`: Before a reaction is removed
- `ReactionRemovedEvent`: After a reaction is removed

### Anonymous Support

Track reactions by device ID for anonymous users, perfect for public-facing content where users don't need to log in.

## Quick Example

Here's a quick example of how easy it is to use reactions:

```php
use JobMetric\Reaction\HasReaction;
use JobMetric\Reaction\CanReact;

// Article model (can receive reactions)
class Article extends Model
{
    use HasReaction;
}

// User model (can give reactions)
class User extends Model
{
    use CanReact;
}

// Usage
$article = Article::find(1);
$user = User::find(1);

// Add a like reaction
$article->addReaction('like', $user);

// Check if user liked the article
$article->hasReaction('like', $user);

// Get reaction count
$article->countReactions('like');

// Toggle reaction
$article->toggleReaction('like', $user);
```
