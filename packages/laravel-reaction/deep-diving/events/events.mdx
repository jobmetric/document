# Events

Laravel Reaction provides three events that are fired during the reaction lifecycle. These events allow you to integrate with notification systems, analytics, caching, and other custom logic.

## Available Events

### ReactionAddEvent

Fired when a new reaction is added to a reactable model.

### ReactionRemovingEvent

Fired before a reaction is removed (soft deleted) from a reactable model.

### ReactionRemovedEvent

Fired after a reaction has been removed (soft deleted) from a reactable model.

```

## Quick Example

```php
use JobMetric\Reaction\Events\ReactionAddEvent;
use JobMetric\Reaction\Events\ReactionRemovedEvent;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

// Listen to reaction added event
Event::listen(ReactionAddEvent::class, function (ReactionAddEvent $event) {
    $reaction = $event->reaction;
    
    // Send notification
    if ($reaction->reactable->author) {
        $reaction->reactable->author->notify(
            new NewReactionNotification($reaction)
        );
    }
    
    // Update cache
    Cache::forget("reactions.{$reaction->reactable_type}.{$reaction->reactable_id}");
});

// Listen to reaction removed event
Event::listen(ReactionRemovedEvent::class, function (ReactionRemovedEvent $event) {
    $reaction = $event->reaction;
    
    // Update cache
    Cache::forget("reactions.{$reaction->reactable_type}.{$reaction->reactable_id}");
});
```
